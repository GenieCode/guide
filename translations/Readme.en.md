The freeCodeCamp community is building a massive and searchable ** "Guide" **.

This reference tool will eventually include thousands of articles that will cover all areas of development, design, and data science - all written in a way that is easily understood by beginners in programming.

This directory is where we plan and maintain the Guide's articles, which are then hosted on our community's website at [`guide.freecodecamp.org`] (https://guide.freecodecamp.org).

## What are the articles in the Guide?

The articles in the Guide are intended to be short so that you can familiarize yourself with the concepts found there, before continuing with more in-depth articles.

The articles in the Guide can be the explanation of a syntax, a design template, the use of aria labels, or what the numbers mean at the top right of your screen when you are on [freecodecamp.org ] (https://freecodecamp.org).

You can find an [example article on HTML elements here] (./ src / pages / html / elements / index.md).

## What can I write as an article?

The Front-end development (adjective with a dash) is when one works on the front end (name without dash). Same for the back end, full stack, and many other compound terms.

We invite you to help us write these articles. You do not have to be an expert in a subject to write about it - this guide is completely open source, so even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.

If you want to help, find a `stub article` on the [Guide site] (https://guide.freecodecamp.org/), write the article, then open a Pull Request (PR). ) to replace the sketch with your article. A pull request (https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) is the way you propose changes. This allows others to know your changes, review them, and adopt them.

If you can not find a draft about a topic you would like to write about, you can open a PR that will create a draft from the draft of your article.

Feel free to ask questions [about Gitter] (https://gitter.im/freeCodeCamp/Contributors) if you do not know where to put a new article in the directory structure.

Before you start writing, be sure to read [the article style guide] (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#article-style-guide) described in [CONTRIBUTING] .md] (CONTRIBUTING.md).
